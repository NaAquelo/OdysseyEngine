# Odyssey
The odyssey game engine.

This engine is built using C and the Vulkan graphics api.
This project is currently in pre development and anyone obtaining a copy or contributing to this project
during early development may keep and distribute their own version of the Odyssey game engine.
However after development is complete then the project will be made as closed source.
